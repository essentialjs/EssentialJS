<h2>Uploading Specifications for essentialjs / constructive </h2>
<p>
The index.html page in the spec directory is used to upload the specifications.
When the page is loaded it will upload them to the service.
Another way to upload specifications is using the Makefile or Rakefile.
</p>
<h2>Kicking off suites</h2>
<p>
You can kick off a suite of Specifications by opening one of the runner pages with a web browser.
There will be a separate page for each of the suites defined for your project.
</p>
<h2>Sample Specifications</h2>
<p>
The common way to run Specs is to execute in the loading page with the examples running in a hidden scope.
The examples will have to leave the DOM unchanged, or restore them upon completion.
The running will create a results IFRAME for posting the results.
